  <h1>Welcome</h1>
      <p><strong>UPX</strong> is a free, secure, portable, extendable, high-performance
      <strong>executable packer</strong> for several executable formats.</p>

  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p><strong>UPX</strong> is an advanced executable file compressor. UPX will typically
  reduce the file size of programs and DLLs by around 50%-70%, thus
  reducing disk space, network load times, download times and
  other distribution and storage costs.</p>

  <p>Programs and libraries compressed by <strong>UPX</strong> are completely self-contained
  and run exactly as before, with no runtime or memory penalty for most
  of the supported formats.</p>

  <p><strong>UPX</strong> supports a number of different executable formats, including
  Windows programs and DLLs, macOS apps and Linux executables.</p>

  <p><strong>UPX</strong> is free software distributed under the term of the GNU General
  Public License. Full source code is available.</p>

  <p><strong>UPX</strong> may be distributed and used freely, even with commercial applications.</p>

  <h1>Overview</h1>
      <p>UPX strengths in a nutshell:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
        <strong>secure</strong>: as UPX is documented Open Source since many years any relevant
        Security/Antivirus software is able to peek inside UPX compressed apps to verify them</li>
        <li>
        <strong>excellent compression ratio</strong>: typically compresses better than
        Zip, use UPX to decrease the size of your distribution!</li>
        <li>
        <strong>very fast decompression</strong>: more than 500 MB/sec on any reasonably modern
        machine</li>
        <li>
        <strong>no memory overhead</strong> for your compressed executables because of in-place
        decompression</li>
        <li>
        <strong>safe</strong>: you can list, test and <u>unpack</u>
        your executables. Also, a checksum
        of both the compressed and uncompressed file is maintained internally.</li>
        <li>
        <strong>universal</strong>: UPX can pack a number of executable formats, including
        Windows programs and DLLs, macOS apps and Linux executables</li>
        <li>
        <strong>portable</strong>: UPX is written in portable endian-neutral C++</li>
        <li>
        <strong>extendable</strong>: because of the class layout it's very easy to add new
        executable formats or new compression algorithms</li>
        <li>
        <strong>free</strong>: UPX is distributed with full source code under the terms of the
        <a href="upx-COPYING.txt">GNU General Public License v2+</a>;
        either under the pure GPLv2+, or (at your option) under the GPLv+2 with special
        exceptions and restrictions granting the free usage for all binaries
        including commercial programs as stated in the
        <a href="upx-license.html">UPX License Agreement</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>You probably understand now why we call UPX the "Ultimate Packer for eXecutables"</p>
